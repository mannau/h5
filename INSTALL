This package provides an Interface to the HDF5 API, see also AUTORS file for
copyright notices.
Depending on the operating system the installation of HDF5 library dependencies
and headers may be required. h5 requires an installed version of the hdf5 
library including its C++ API and header files.

1. LINUX 
1.1 DEBIAN-BASED, e.g. UBUNTU
	For newer Debian-based Linux systems (e.g. Debian >= 8.0, Ubuntu >= 15.04) the 
	following commands can be used to install the dependencies:
	$ sudo apt-get install libhdf5-dev
	On older platforms (e.g. Debian < 8.0, Ubuntu < 15.04) it is required to install
	from source using the following steps (for HDF5 ver 1.10patch1):
	$ wget https://www.hdfgroup.org/ftp/HDF5/releases/hdf5-1.10/hdf5-1.10.0-patch1/src/hdf5-1.10.0-patch1.tar.gz
	$ tar -xzf hdf5-1.10.0-patch1.tar.gz
	$ cd hdf5-1.10.0-patch1
	$ ./configure --prefix=/usr/local --enable-cxx --enable-build-mode=production 
	$ sudo make install
1.2 RPM-BASED, e.g. FEDORA
	For RPM-BASED platforms the following command can be used:
	$ sudo yum install hdf5-devel

2. MACOSX
	Using MacOSX and Homebrew (http://brew.sh) the following command can be used 
	to install the HDF5 library dependencies and headers:
	$ brew install homebrew/science/hdf5 --enable-cxx

3. WINDOWS
	The h5 package already ships with the compiled version of the HDF library 
	1.8.14 with the C++ API, High-Level (HL) and ZLIB compression enabled for 
	32Bit and 64Bit architectures. The required headers and pre-compiled binaries
	are located at https://github.com/mannau/h5-libwin and are downloaded during
	the installation process by the configure.win script.
