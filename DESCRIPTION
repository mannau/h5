Description: S4 Interface to the 'HDF5' library supporting fast storage and
    retrieval of R-objects like vectors, matrices and arrays to binary files in
    a language independent format. The 'HDF5' format can therefore be used as
    an alternative to R's save/load mechanism. Since h5 is able to access only
    subsets of stored data it can also handle data sets which do not fit into
    memory.
